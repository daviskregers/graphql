# Learning GraphQL

This is code written while taking a course at [GraphQL Full Course - Novice to Expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8SzALpx1Q). 

This is basically a reading list app written on node.js and react, while using GraphQL. You can view a list of books, get details for them and add new ones.
